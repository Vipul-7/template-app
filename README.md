# Project Name - Template App

- This project helps you to use the template created by community.
- It is the practice project to learn typeorm, typescript, tailwindcss with my existing knowledge of node, express, react, react-query, etc.
- I used [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components for the UI.
- I used react for frontend and node, express for backend with typescript.
- I used postgresql as database and typeorm as ORM.
- I used [react-query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) for asynchronous state management.
- I used tailwindcss for styling.
